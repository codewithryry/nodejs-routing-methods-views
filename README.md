# Node.js Routing, Methods, and Views

This is a Node.js project demonstrating basic routing, HTTP methods, and view rendering using Express and EJS. It is created as part of an activity to understand the fundamentals of building web applications with Node.js.

## Project Structure

- **`app.js`**: Main application file where the Express server is initialized, middleware is set up, and routes are defined.
- **`package.json` & `package-lock.json`**: Contains the project metadata, dependencies, and their versions.
- **`node_modules/`**: Directory for installed npm packages.
- **`public/`**: Static assets (CSS, images, JavaScript) are stored here.
- **`routes/`**: Contains route definitions that handle incoming requests.
- **`views/`**: EJS templates that are rendered in response to HTTP requests.
- **`images/`**: Any image files used to see the wakatime and screenshot of the activity.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/codewithryry/nodejs-routing-methods-views.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd nodejs-routing-methods-views
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash

## Usage

1. Start the server:
    ```bash
    node app.js
    ```
